## Requirements

Vagrant and VirtualBox installed

A directory ~/vagrantShared 

## next steps
setup.sh should handle every install for all users
then we should have a startup script that execs on 1st entry to setup user and password

## goals
nvim fully installed & confed
ssh key of host should be added to authorized_keys current vm to allow ssh directly into it and not using ssh vagrant all the time
